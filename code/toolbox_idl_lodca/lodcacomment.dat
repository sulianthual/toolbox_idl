XXXXXXX Restart File for reading initial conditions  (filenames defini depuis le repertoire lodca, mais mieux vaut les definir depuis la racine !)
XXXXXXX History File for writing restart conditions (can then be used as a Restart File)

-----Comment wind files
XXXXXXX File for Wind Forcing: mensual(every 15th of month) or 10days (must always start on 15th !, then 25th,5th,...) depending on DTWIND
-----Comment clim files
XXXXXXX File for clim wind (UNIT ?)
XXXXXXX File for wind divergence (not used, only for CZ model)
XXXXXXX File for clim sst (UNIT?)(one vertical profile of clim temperature is set in ztmsuf.f l404)  
XXXXXXX File for clim vertical velocity (UNIT?)at the base of mixed layer (estimate from dxu,dyv 50meters)
XXXXXXX File for clim zonal and meridional currents (UNIT?)
-----Comment statistical atmoshpere (SVD) files
XXXXXXX File for standard deviation of PCs (UNIT?)
XXXXXXX File for SST SVD modes (UNIT?)
XXXXXXX File for zonal (and meridionnal) wind stress modes (UNIT?)
-----Comment for other parameters
